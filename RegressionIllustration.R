#Study the impact of fitting regression models of varying degrees - linear, quadratic, and cubic to a data set 
#consisting of randomly generated predictor variables (X) and response variables (y) generated from a know function 
#with added random noise.

#We create a train and a test sample from the data set using Holdout cross validation 
#technique. Fit the linear, quadratic, and cubic models to the training set. Compute the training mean squared error (MSE) and then check the MSE for the 
#test set using the regeression coefficients.  

#We plot the scatter plot overlaid with various regression fits and finally compare the 
#MSE for the training and test set. 

#We do note that this exercise can be made more generic by using multiple training and test sets 
#as suggested in the literature.
